# vscode-fastarduino README

This is the README for "vscode-fastarduino" extension. This extension makes it easy to work on Arduino (or AVR MCU) projects based on [FastArduino](https://github.com/jfpoilpret/fast-arduino-lib) library. It is also used to work on fastArduino library itself.

## Features

TODO

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

FastArduino is based on C++, hence this extension needs the following VSCode extensions installed:
- C/C++
- C/C++ Clang Command Adapter

In addition, I use the following extensions but they are not mandatory:
- Include Autocomplete
- TODO Highlight

## Extension Settings

TODO

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something
